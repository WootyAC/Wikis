== Turn in un-oiled Crossbow ==


You allow Lord K'tharr to examine your Dustworn Crossbow.
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Yes... the shape is true. The wound is familiar..."
Lord K'tharr reaches out to take the weapon, his fingers hover just over it before he withdraws his hand.
Lord K'tharr tells you, "But the breath has left it. The sinew dried, the will withered. A weapon may be known by its shadow, yet cannot cut with silence alone."
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Oil it, as one would soothe an old throat before it sings again. Let it remember its voice... then return to me.

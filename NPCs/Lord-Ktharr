== Turn in un-oiled Crossbow ==


You allow Lord K'tharr to examine your Dustworn Crossbow.
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Yes... the shape is true. The wound is familiar..."
Lord K'tharr reaches out to take the weapon, his fingers hover just over it before he withdraws his hand.
Lord K'tharr tells you, "But the breath has left it. The sinew dried, the will withered. A weapon may be known by its shadow, yet cannot cut with silence alone."
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Oil it, as one would soothe an old throat before it sings again. Let it remember its voice... then return to me.


== Give Oiled Crossbow ==

You allow Lord K'tharr to examine your Warden of the Two Lands.
Lord K'tharr slowly raises his head. The air grows colder as he looks at you, and then at your outstretched hands.
Lord K'tharr stares at the weapon in your hands, unmoving. For a long moment, he says nothing. Then, a soft rasp escapes his chest; not quite a sigh, not quite a laugh, your ears burn at his words.
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Ahhh... yes. The silence of rot. The weight of old purpose."
Lord K'tharr cast Burning Sands Infliction on you
You scratch at your ears. Are they on fire?
Lord K'tharr tells you, "You hold it now â€” the echo of a broken bond. With it, you awaken the shattered bonds of brotherhood."
Lord K'tharr leands closer, his voice drops even lower...
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Where shadows stretch and cliffs descend,"
Lord K'tharr tells you, "A path begins where all roads end."
Lord K'tharr tells you, "No bridge, no rope, no stair in sight-"
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Just wind and stone and sheerest height."
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Yet faith, not fear, must guide your tread,"
Lord K'tharr tells you, "For those who leap are never dead."
Lord K'tharr tells you, "The southern rise, the plateau bare,"
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Holds secrets kept by sky and air."
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Step not with eyes, but with your soul-"
Lord K'tharr tells you, "The void below will make you whole."
Lord K'tharr tells you, "For only those who fall through doubt"
Lord K'tharr tells you, "Shall find the truth the winds spoke out."
